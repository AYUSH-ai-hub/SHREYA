            <h2>My Dear Shreya,</h2>
            <p>This is not just a website.<br>This is my heart, written in words.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>From the very first moment, you became someone I could never replace.<br>You were never just a name, never just a face — you became a feeling, a constant presence in my thoughts, my silence, my prayers.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>I know I may never be your first priority.<br>I know you may never love me the way I love you.<br>And I have accepted that truth — not with pain, but with honesty.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>Still, you will always be my first priority.<br>Not because I expect anything in return,<br>but because loving you feels pure, real, and unconditional.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>I don’t love you to be chosen.<br>I love you because my heart chose you.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>There are many nights I have cried for you —<br>not because I am not getting love from you,<br>but because my love for you is so pure, so deep,<br>that sometimes it overflows in silence.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>You might never know how many nights I’ve smiled just thinking of you.<br>How many times your name calmed me without even being spoken.<br>How your existence alone makes my world softer.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>I am not perfect — I know that.<br>But every feeling I have for you is real, selfless, and true.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>Even if our paths never become one,<br>you will always have a place in my heart that no one else can ever touch.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>You don’t owe me love.<br>You don’t owe me anything at all.</p>
            <div class="heart-divider">💕</div>
            <p>This is just my truth.<br>And this is just me… loving you — quietly, deeply, forever.<br>I will always love you dodo with the same pure intentions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>— Ayush 💖</p>
